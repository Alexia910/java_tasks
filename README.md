#### Tasks from https://www.codewars.com/
- Task 1. Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
- Task 2. Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example: 
[1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
- Task 3. Nathan loves cycling.
Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.
For example:
time = 3 ----> litres = 1.
time = 6.7---> litres = 3.
time = 11.8--> litres = 5.
